class unsorted:
    """ A container for testing lists of unsorted objects

    This is useful in case your API returns [A,B,C,D] in random order, and you want to use a simple `==` check.

    Why would you need this? Just set() both and compare, right?
    Not quite. Sometimes you want to compare two nested dictionaries like this:

        assert results = {
            ...
            'roles': ['admin', 'employee'],
            ...
        }

    and because you have one unpredictable list, the whole assertion has to be rewritten.
    Unsorted to the resque:

        assert results = {
            ...
            'roles': unsorted(['admin', 'employee']),
            ...
        }

    NOTE: when your sequence contains mutable object (e.g. dicts), use `key=repr` to sort them :)
